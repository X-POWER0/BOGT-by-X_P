# BOGT-by-X_P
Bundle of game tests by X-P
<br>It's mini games bundle X-P created test runs with Code(project files)
<br>Making this to understand, learn mechanics of game engines (Unity, Godot, Mono, KSNA and other) to better and faster create own games.
<br>Here will be build of all mini games in one and separately.
<br>(Will try to make builds on every platform that can run it, so If You interested in build on specific LEAVE COMMENT)
<br>All code can be downloaded and reused(with or without crediting X-P, but It would be nice to add link to this bundle, so anyone who <br>would like to fast make own game just by replacing art other assets could find it easy.)
<br>each mini game will be with links and credits of tutorials used To create It.
<br>Made on Unity 5 to be able make lightweight build for Widows XP so.
<br>X-P would truly appreciate if You send  Here links to projects You made Using this Bundle.
<br>Will try to construct all in order so It understandable and easy to use, but it will take time and 
<br>appreciate any suggestions and corrections  in comments.
