# BOGT_by_X-P
<br>Bundle of game tests by X-P
<br>It's mini test games bundle by X-P. Attempts at the start of GameDev journey.
<br>Links to Tutorials and Projects learned and all working along a way. Hope it will be useful for others starting or want to try making games.  
<br><p></p>

><p>Would really Like To see projects You started on GameDev experience or starting</p>(Share on <a href = "https://x-pmods.itch.io/bogt_by_x-p">Itch.io</a> in comments definitely going  to check them out)<br>

<br>Tests  of ideas, Code samples, Project files, Assets. 
<br>Working on this to understand, learn mechanics of game engines (Unity, Godot, Mono, XNA and other) to better and faster create own games.
<br><br><b>Here will be builds of all mini games in one and links to separate projects by Timeline of creation.</b>
<br><br>(Will try to make builds on every platform that can run it, so If You interested in build on specific LEAVE COMMENT)
<br>All code can be downloaded and reused(with or without crediting X-P, but It would be nice to add link to this bundle, so anyone who <br>would like to fast make own game just by replacing art other assets could find it easy.)
<br>each mini game will be with links and credits of tutorials used To create It.
<br>!!!X-P would truly appreciate if You send  Here links to projects You made Using this Bundle.!!
<br>Will try to construct all in order so It understandable and easy to use, but it will take time and 
<br>appreciate any suggestions and corrections  in comments.
<br>
<br>
<br>Starting from Unity 5, XNA and up, goal to make make lightweight versions and builds for Widows XP supported.
(Want to try making builds on different platforms that can run them, so If You interested in builds on specific LEAVE COMMENT)
