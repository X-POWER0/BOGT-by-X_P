(03.08.2023)
<br> - minigame on theme of flappy bird mechanic but with own editions.
<br>Software used: Unity 5.2.5f, Gimp, Notepad++, MonoDevelop, BoscaCeoil

<br><br>(Will try to make builds on every platform that can run it, so If You interested in build on specific LEAVE COMMENT)
<br>All code can be downloaded and reused(with or without crediting X-P, but It would be nice to add link to this bundle, so anyone who <br>would like to fast make own game just by replacing art other assets could find it easy.)
<br>each mini game will be with links and credits of tutorials used To create It.
<br>!!!X-P would truly appreciate if You send  Here links to projects You made Using this Bundle.!!
<br>Will try to construct all in order so It understandable and easy to use, but it will take time and 
<br>appreciate any suggestions and corrections  in comments.
<br>
<br>
<br>Starting from Unity 5, XNA and up, goal to make make lightweight versions and builds for Widows XP supported.
(Want to try making builds on different platforms that can run them, so If You interested in builds on specific LEAVE COMMENT)
